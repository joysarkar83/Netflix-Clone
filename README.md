# Netflix Clone

A **static frontend clone** of the Netflix UI, tailored for **1920×1080 (Full HD) displays**.  
Built as a **learning exercise** in layout, styling, and UI replication using only **HTML & CSS**.

- Custom fonts and imagery organized into `fonts/` and `images/`.
- Layout optimized for fullscreen desktop viewing (1920×1080).
